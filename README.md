This is a REST API built with Flask that removes the background from uploaded images using the Rembg library.

### Features:

Accepts image files as POST requests to the /remove-bg endpoint.
Employs Rembg for efficient background removal.
Saves the processed image to a designated output folder (configurable).
Returns a JSON response indicating success, error messages, and (optionally) the saved image path.
Requirements:

Python 3.x

[Flask (pip install Flask)](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/)

[Rembg (pip install rembg)](https://pypi.org/project/rembg/)

## Setup:

### Install dependencies:

```

pip install Flask rembg

```

Use code with caution.
content_copy
Modify the OUTPUT_FOLDER variable in the code (located in app.py) to specify the desired location for saving processed images.

Running the Application:

Save the code as app.py.

Run the application from your terminal:

Bash
python app.py
Use code with caution.
content_copy
This will start the Flask development server, usually accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/remove-bg.

### Usage:

Use Postman or any HTTP client to send a POST request to the /remove-bg endpoint.
Set the request body type to "form-data".
Include the image file in the form-data with the key "image" (or as defined in your API).
Send the request.
Example Response (on Success):

### JSON
```
{
  "success": true,
  "image_path": "processed_images/3f4c2a1b-e4e6-4f19-b8ab-7d4d2f1b4c52.png"
}
```


## Image Processing Example

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="input_image/ai-generated-8095540.jpg" alt="Input Image" width="170" height="150"></td>
    <td><img src="processed_images/0feca457-5e10-40eb-ab4c-584a054fa478.png" alt="Output Image" width="170" height="150"></td>
     <td><img src="input_image/elephant-1421167_1920.jpg" alt="Input Image" width="170" height="150"></td>
    <td><img src="processed_images/7e36b5f1-66c3-4623-b398-ae92e14defb5.png" alt="Output Image" width="170" height="150"></td>
     <td><img src="input_image/oldtimer-1197800_1920.jpg" alt="Input Image" width="150" height="150"></td>
    <td><img src="processed_images/296c42fe-26c5-441a-83f4-e144d5ad3eb8.png" alt="Output Image" width="150" height="150"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Description:** This example demonstrates the image processing algorithm applied to the input image to produce the output image.

Use code with caution.

Error Handling:

The API handles potential errors like missing image files, background removal failures, and invalid request methods. In case of errors, the API returns a JSON response with a "success" flag set to false and a descriptive error message.

### Customization:

You can modify the response format to include additional information if needed.
Consider adding support for different image formats (consult Rembg documentation).
Implement security measures for production environments (e.g., user authentication).
